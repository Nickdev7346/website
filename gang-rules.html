                            <h3>1.1 Gang Roleplay Over Violence</h3>
                            <p>Gang roleplay isn't just about fighting; it's about creating stories, forming alliances, running operations, and developing rivalries. Engage with others in a way that goes beyond just attacking or dominating other gangs.</p>
                            <p>Build and maintain in-character relationships that make the gang lifestyle dynamic and complex. Organize, plan, and communicate with allies and rivals in-character to develop your gang's reputation and influence.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>1.2 Respect the Community and Other Players</h3>
                            <p>Gang roleplay should never cross into harassment or out-of-character aggression. Always keep gang conflicts respectful and grounded in roleplay.</p>
                            <p>Remember that everyone is here to have fun. Keep conflicts in-character, and avoid toxic behavior out-of-character.</p>

                            <h3>1.3 Limited Firearms Use</h3>
                            <p>Firearms are restricted and hard to come by on this server. As such, gangs should primarily rely on melee weapons (e.g., knives, bats, hammers) for confrontations. Guns are considered high-level items, and using them without roleplay justification can lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
                            <p>Firearms should only appear in the most critical or premeditated scenarios, such as planned hits or major gang wars. Avoid "brandishing" firearms casually; it should be a rare and serious act when done.</p>

                            <h3>2.1 Realistic Weaponry</h3>
                            <p>Stick to melee weapons as your primary choice. Knives, bats, machetes, brass knuckles, and improvised weapons like broken bottles or pipes are encouraged.</p>
                            <p>Firearms should only be used if explicitly authorized through roleplay, and even then, they should be treated as rare and highly illegal. Any unauthorized gun use can result in punishment or weapon confiscation.</p>

                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>2.2 No Random Gang Violence (No RDM)</h3>
                            <p>Do not attack other players or gangs randomly. There should always be an in-character reason or development leading to violence, whether it's a territory dispute, revenge, or a planned hit.</p>
                            <p>Give opposing gang members a chance to respond to your actions. Avoid ambushing or killing other players without prior interactions or roleplay build-up.</p>

                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>2.3 No "One-Hit Kills"</h3>
                            <p>Avoid unrealistic power moves or "one-hit" kill situations. If a fight escalates, allow for some back-and-forth rather than simply downing or killing someone instantly. Gang roleplay is about developing stories, not simply winning fights.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>2.4 Consequences of Combat</h3>
                            <p>Injuries from fights should be roleplayed seriously. If your character is wounded, play out the effects of their injuries, and consider taking a step back from gang activities while they "recover."</p>
                            <p>If your character "dies" in a gang fight, follow the New Life Rule: forget the events that led to your death, and do not immediately seek revenge.</p>

                            <h3>3.1 Realistic Gang Structure</h3>
                            <p>Create a believable gang structure with leaders, enforcers, and recruits. Gang roles should be distinct, with clear responsibilities, goals, and skills.</p>
                            <p>Avoid letting every member act independently. Gang members should work under the guidance of leadership and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the group with solo activities.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>3.2 Gang Size Limit</h3>
                            <p>Gangs are limited to a maximum number of active members (e.g., 10-15 members, depending on server rules). This is to maintain balanced interactions and prevent one gang from overwhelming others.</p>
                            <p>Alliances between gangs are allowed, but massive groups acting as a single "super gang" are prohibited.</p>

                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>3.3 Gang Appearance and Identity</h3>
                            <p>Gangs should develop unique identities through clothing, colors, or symbols, but keep it realistic. Avoid unrealistic gang attire or behavior that doesn't fit the theme of British gang life.</p>
                            <p>Identify your gang members with subtlety; this isn't Los Santos, so full-on gang "colors" are less common. Stick to a style or an accessory that makes sense for your gang.</p>

                            <p>Gangs may establish territories, but avoid claiming the entire map. Territories are for realistic roleplay, not to force control over others.</p>
                            <p>Respect the territories of other gangs and avoid unnecessary aggression unless there's a valid in-character reason to escalate. This keeps interactions realistic and encourages meaningful turf rivalries.</p>

                            <h3>4.2 Turf Battles and Territory Disputes</h3>
                            <p>If a turf war or territory conflict arises, it should be played out over time with roleplay build-up, rather than a sudden series of ambushes or deathmatches.</p>
                            <p>Use melee weapons for most turf battles, and plan encounters that let both gangs engage in dialogue or showdowns rather than instant conflict. Guns should only come out in the most extreme scenarios.</p>

                            <p>Gangs may engage in realistic criminal activities like low-level drug dealing, robbery, and other street-level crimes. Keep operations grounded and avoid unrealistic or massive schemes without proper in-character planning.</p>
                            <p>Money-making activities should fit the character of a gang member. Avoid overly organized or unrealistic setups that don't reflect British street crime culture.</p>

                            <p>Avoid setting up constant, repetitive "grinding" operations for money or resources. Gangs should generate income through roleplay interactions, trades, or heists, not endlessly farming server mechanics.</p>
                            <p>Encourage trade and interaction with other players, creating more diverse criminal operations that allow for organic growth and rivalry.</p>

                            <h3>6.1 Respect Police Roleplay</h3>
                            <p>In encounters with police, roleplay realistically. Don't try to "win" every interaction or constantly evade arrest. Accept that getting caught is part of gang life and use it as a chance to deepen roleplay.</p>
                            <p>If an arrest is unavoidable, resist the temptation to "combat log" or quit to avoid consequences. Serve jail time, plan breakouts, or plot revenge in-character instead.</p>

                        <div class="rule-item">
                            <h3>6.2 Realistic Escapes and Chases</h3>
                            <p>If chased by police, keep it grounded. Don't attempt unrealistic stunts or endless chases. If you're caught, roleplay the consequences.</p>
                            <p>Avoid bringing out firearms on police during regular encounters. Firearms should only be used against police in highly planned and critical situations, and expect serious in-character repercussions if you do.</p>

                            <p>Gang roleplay should be about creating stories and moments, not constantly dominating others. Avoid forcing other players to "lose" or feel frustrated without fair reason.</p>
                            <p>Out-of-character conflicts or grudges should be avoided. If a situation goes too far or feels uncomfortable, reach out to admins or moderators rather than taking matters into your own hands.</p>

                            <p>If you experience an issue with another gang or player, report it properly to the admin team. Provide details and evidence if possible, and avoid starting disputes in general chat.</p>
                            <p>Use the appeals process respectfully if you disagree with a disciplinary decision. Engaging with staff in a calm and constructive manner helps maintain a positive community.</p>
